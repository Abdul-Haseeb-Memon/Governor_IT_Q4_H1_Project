# Vision-Based Object Understanding

This chapter covers implementing vision-based object understanding systems that can detect, identify, and link objects to ROS actions. You'll learn how to build systems that allow robots to interact with their environment visually through object detection and identification techniques.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Implement object detection and identification systems using computer vision
- Link vision outputs to ROS 2 actions for robot interaction
- Create complete perception pipelines that integrate multiple vision components
- Process multi-sensor data for comprehensive environmental understanding
- Apply semantic segmentation for scene understanding
- Design vision-based action planning systems

## Chapter Overview

Vision-based object understanding enables robots to perceive and interact with their environment. This chapter is divided into three main sections:

1. **Object Detection and Identification**: Learn how to detect and classify objects in the robot's environment using computer vision techniques
2. **Linking Vision Outputs to ROS Actions**: Understand how to connect vision processing results to robot control actions
3. **Complete Perception Pipeline**: Implement a unified system that processes visual input and provides comprehensive environmental understanding

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should have:

- Understanding of ROS 2 concepts (covered in Module 1)
- Basic knowledge of computer vision and OpenCV
- Python programming knowledge
- Completed the previous chapters in this module (Voice-to-Action and LLM Planning)

## Getting Started

The first step is to learn about object detection and identification techniques. Follow the [Object Detection and Identification](./object-detection.md) guide to understand how to implement computer vision systems for robot perception.
