# Language-Driven Planning with LLMs

This chapter covers using Large Language Models to translate natural language goals into executable action sequences for high-level task planning in humanoid robots. You'll learn how to generate robot action sequences from natural language instructions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Use LLMs to translate natural language goals into robot action sequences
- Generate executable action sequences from high-level commands
- Implement high-level task planning systems for complex multi-step tasks
- Integrate environmental context into task planning
- Handle task dependencies and execution monitoring
- Implement adaptive planning with failure recovery

## Chapter Overview

Language-driven planning enables robots to understand and execute complex tasks described in natural language. This chapter is divided into three main sections:

1. **Translating Natural Language Goals to Actions**: Learn how to use LLMs to convert high-level goals into specific robot actions
2. **Generating Executable Action Sequences**: Understand how to convert planned actions into ROS 2 messages that can be executed by the robot
3. **High-Level Task Planning for Robots**: Implement sophisticated planning systems that handle complex, multi-step tasks with dependencies

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should have:

- Understanding of ROS 2 concepts (covered in Module 1)
- Basic knowledge of LLMs and API integration
- Python programming knowledge
- Completed the Voice-to-Action Interfaces chapter (Module 4, Chapter 1)

## Getting Started

The first step is to learn how to translate natural language goals into robot actions. Follow the [Translating Natural Language Goals to Actions](./natural-language-goals.md) guide to understand how LLMs can be used for goal translation.
