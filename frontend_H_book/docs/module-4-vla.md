# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to Module 4 of the humanoid robotics documentation series. This module covers the integration of language models, perception, and action in humanoid robotics through a comprehensive Vision-Language-Action (VLA) pipeline.

## Overview

In this module, you will learn how to build systems that connect voice commands to planning and execution for autonomous humanoid robots. The module covers:

- **Voice-to-Action Interfaces**: Using OpenAI Whisper for speech recognition and converting voice commands into structured inputs
- **Language-Driven Planning with LLMs**: Translating natural language goals into action sequences for high-level task planning
- **Vision-Based Object Understanding**: Object detection and identification with integration to ROS actions
- **Capstone Project**: An end-to-end VLA pipeline connecting voice command → plan → navigation → manipulation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Implement voice recognition systems that can control humanoid robots through spoken commands
- Use Large Language Models to generate executable action sequences from natural language goals
- Build vision-based object understanding systems that interact with ROS actions
- Create a complete autonomous humanoid system that integrates voice, vision, and action

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should be familiar with:

- ROS 2 fundamentals (covered in Module 1)
- Simulation environments (covered in Module 2)
- Basic AI and perception concepts (covered in Module 3)

## Module Chapters

1. [Voice-to-Action Interfaces](./module-4-vla/voice-to-action/index.md) - Learn to implement voice recognition using OpenAI Whisper
2. [Language-Driven Planning with LLMs](./module-4-vla/llm-planning/index.md) - Understand how to translate natural language goals into action sequences
3. [Vision-Based Object Understanding](./module-4-vla/vision-understanding/index.md) - Implement computer vision systems for object detection and identification
4. [Capstone: The Autonomous Humanoid](./module-4-vla/capstone-vla/index.md) - Build a complete VLA system integrating all components

## Next Steps

Start with the first chapter on [Voice-to-Action Interfaces](./module-4-vla/voice-to-action/index.md) to learn about implementing voice recognition systems for humanoid robots.
