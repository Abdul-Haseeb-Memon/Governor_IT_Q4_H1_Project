# Introduction to ROS 2 Documentation

Welcome to the ROS 2 Documentation module! This educational resource is designed for AI and robotics students with basic Python knowledge who want to understand the fundamentals of ROS 2 as the middleware connecting AI logic to humanoid robot control.

## Module Overview

This module is structured as three progressive chapters:

1. **ROS 2 Fundamentals** - Understanding nodes, topics, services, and the high-level humanoid data flow
2. **Python Agents with rclpy** - Creating Python-based ROS 2 nodes to bridge AI decisions to robot controllers
3. **Humanoid Modeling with URDF** - Understanding robot description format and integration with simulators

Each chapter builds upon the previous one, following pedagogical best practices for technical education.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the purpose of ROS 2 as robotic middleware
- Create Python-based ROS 2 nodes using rclpy
- Understand URDF for humanoid robot modeling
- Describe how AI decisions flow through ROS 2 to robot controllers
- Integrate robot models with ROS 2 simulators
