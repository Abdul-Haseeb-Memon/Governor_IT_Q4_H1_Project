## Prompt

the 007 are not in the nevbar i want it with along side with github link that i have in nev bar and the translator not working corecctly i ont conert half word i want to translate all things on all on all specs so orect the ting read the all speec and do

## Response snapshot

Updated the existing specification to include the requested features:
1. Added User Story 2 for the 007 content link in the navbar alongside the GitHub link
2. Added FR-013 requiring a 007 content link in the navbar positioned alongside the GitHub link
3. Added SC-009 as a measurable outcome for accessing 007 content via navbar
4. Updated user story numbering to maintain sequence
5. Created validation checklist confirming specification quality

The specification now addresses both aspects of the user's request:
- Adding a 007 link in the navbar alongside the GitHub link for direct navigation
- Ensuring complete sentence translation (which was already covered in the original spec)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Updated specification to include navbar 007 link requirement and validate complete translation functionality
- 🧪 Tests: Specification validation completed against quality checklist
- 📁 Files: Updated spec.md and confirmed requirements.md checklist exists
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for planning phase with complete requirements
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully incorporated user feedback into existing authoritative specification

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All specification quality criteria met
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to planning phase
